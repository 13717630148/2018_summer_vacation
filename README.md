# 2018 summer vacation in NGN
A work and study schedule.
## 2018.7.27 Friday
### Planï¼š
1. Read paper "Attention Is All You Need". Then read a blog about the paper and Keras code for attention mechanism. ***Partly Completed***. To be honest, this paper is a little dificult to read. So I don't fully understand.  
2. Make a summary about attention mechanism and try to think up a new method to implement. ***Completed***. I think I can make use of different AM now.  
3. Discuss with Dr.Wu about Keras source code, some implementation details and some puzzles. ***Partly Completed***. I know how to use input_shape, but MASK remains a puzzle.  
4. Code... ***Completed***. I implement SelfAttention and AdditiveAttention layers with Keras.  
## 2018.7.28 Saturday
### Plan:
1. Read paper "Unsupervised Word and Dependency Path Embeddings for Aspect Term Extraction". Try to understand how to embed features into NN. ***Partly Completed***. 
2. Read the code about embedding on Github.***Partly Completed***.
3. Discuss with Dr.Wu what to do next and ask about the progress of paper. ***Not Completed***.
4. Try to understand Mask. ***Partly Completed***.
5. Code...  
## 2018.7.29 Sunday
### Plan:
1. Read paper. Think about some ideas which can be used in Aspect-Etraction task.  
2. Run some baselines.  
3. Chat with Hammer about the competition and conference.  
4. Code...
